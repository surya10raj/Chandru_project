        <li><strong>Powdery mildew - Podosphaera xanthii:</strong> To eradicate mild to heavy powdery mildew infections, use a horticultural oil such as JMS Stylet Oil, Saf-T-Side Spray Oil, Sunspray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil, or one of the plant-based oils such as neem oil (e.g., Powdery Mildew Killer) or jojoba oil (e.g., E-rase).</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf spot - Xanthomonas:</strong> Provide frequent treatment of neem oil or another fungicide to the foliage. Copper-based fungicides are safe and effective for most plants, but always do your research – copper can be harmful to certain plants. Avoid getting water onto the leaves as it recovers. Keep the plant away from other plants temporarily.</li>

    <h3>Negative Aspects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Rot - Pythium:</strong> Assess the damage: remove the snake plant from its pot and check the roots. Healthy roots will be firm and white; infected roots will be brown and mushy. Remove any infected roots using sterilized scissors or a knife. Remove affected leaves to help your snake plant direct energy to new, healthy growth. Repot the snake plant in fresh, well-draining soil suitable for succulents. Choose a pot with adequate drainage. Use clean water to lightly water in the snake plant, but be careful to avoid overwatering.</li>
        <li><strong>Powdery Mildew - Erysiphe:</strong> Remove the infected leaves from the plant. Apply a fungicide spray, neem oil, or horticultural oil to the plant’s affected areas to control the infection’s spread. Make sure to follow the instructions on the label carefully. Keep your plant somewhere where it can receive the proper light requirements (bright, indirect light). Choose a location with adequate airflow. Allow space between plants to ensure proper circulation. Regularly inspect plants for signs of infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Southern Blight - Sclerotium rolfsii:</strong> Prune the infected leaves using sterilized pruners. Sterilize these pruners before touching any other plant. Repot your snake plant using fresh, uncontaminated soil. If reusing the same pot, clean thoroughly before planting. Apply a fungicide that treats southern blight.</li>
        <li><strong>Red Leaf Spot - Helminthosporium:</strong> Remove any infected leaves using sterilized scissors or a knife. Ensure plants are well-spaced to avoid overcrowding. Choose a well-ventilated location with good airflow and avoid excessive moisture. Apply a fungicide labeled for use on ornamental plants. Avoid overfertilizing to maintain nutritional balance and plant resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Rust - Heterobasidiomycetes:</strong> Remove the infected leaves from the plant. Avoid growing conditions that favor rust. Provide good ventilation, monitor humidity levels, and water at soil level to avoid wetting the foliage. For severe infections, apply a fungicide suitable for rust in ornamental plants. Ensure good hygiene when pruning to prevent spreading via cross-contamination.</li>

        <li><strong>Bacterial Wilt - Xanthomonas:</strong> The cultural practices adopted for managing soft rot are also to be adopted for bacterial wilt. The seed rhizomes may be treated with streptocycline 200ppm for 30 minutes and shade dried before planting. Once the disease is noticed in the field all beds should be drenched with Bordeaux mixture 1% or copper oxychloride 0.2%.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Root Rot - Pythium spp.:</strong> Trimming off all the affected roots and washing away all the soil on the roots that are affected can help in treating root rot in peace lily. Also, get rid of the soil when you think is fungus-infected and also sterilize it.</li>
        <li><strong>Mosaic Virus - Arabis mosaic virus:</strong> There are no chemical controls for this disease. The best treatments are prevention and control. Prevention starts with purchasing resistant varieties of lilies. Additionally, if you see signs of the disease, dig up the lily and destroy it to prevent the virus from spreading to other plants. Use bleach on any hand or cutting tools to disinfect them and prevent the virus from extending.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaf Blight - Phytophthora nicotianae:</strong> You can cut off all of the brown rotting materials, or anything fuzzy, soak the roots in warm water for a few minutes, and repot the plant. Root rot is commonly caused by overwatering, or standing water.</li>

        <li><strong>Anthracnose - Colletotrichum dracaenophilum:</strong> Thiophanate-methyl and difenoconazole + azoxytrobin at ≥15 ppm completely inhibited the pathogen growth.
