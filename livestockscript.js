    <h3>Negative Aspects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>White clover mosaic - White clover mosaic virus (WCMV):</strong> 
       
        Fungicides will NOT treat this viral disease, plant resistant varieties when available or purchase transplants from a reputable source, do NOT save seeds from infected crops, spot treat with least-toxic, natural pest control products, such as Safer Soap, Bon-Neem, and diatomaceous earth, to reduce the number of disease-carrying insects, harvest-Guard® row cover will help keep insect pests off vulnerable crops/ transplants and should be installed until bloom, remove all perennial weeds, using least-toxic herbicides, within 100 yards of your garden plot, the virus can be spread through human activity, tools, and equipment. Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination, avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet), avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants. Cigarettes and other tobacco products may be infected and can spread the virus, remove and destroy all infected plants. Do NOT compost.</li>
        <li><strong>Alfalfa mosaic - Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV):</strong> The best way to control alfalfa mosaic virus is to avoid planting peppers near alfalfa fields. No resistance is currently available in commercial pepper cultivars.</li>
        <li><strong>Clover phyllody - Mycoplasma:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants, to control vector, spray NSKE @ 5% or neem oil @ 2%, seed treatment with imidacloprid 600 FS @ 7.5ml/kg, spray Quinalphos 25 EC 800 ml/ac or thiamethoxam 25WG @ 40 g/ac or imidacloprid 17.8SL @ 40 ml/ac, intercropping of Sesamum + Redgram (6:1).</li>
        <li><strong>Clover rot - Sclerotinia trifoliorum:</strong> Remove and Destroy. Immediate removal of white clover plants exhibiting root rot symptoms is critical. This step halts the spread of the disease to neighboring plants. Ensure to dispose of the affected plants properly; do not compost as this can become a source of reinfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Grey mould - Botrytis cinerea:</strong> Fungicides for the home garden that contain chlorothalonil can be used on most vegetable crops for gray mold control. Check the product label for the pre-harvest interval. Gray mold on grapes, blueberries, peaches, nectarines, and plums can be controlled with sprays of captan.</li>
        <li><strong>Wart disease - Physoderma trifolii:</strong> Once identified, the fungus can be effectively eliminated by removing the horses from the infected pastures and using a pasture-friendly broad-leaf herbicide to eliminate any remaining broadleaf plants, such as clover. Another clover likely to grow in your pastures as fall weather begins is alsike clover.</li>
        <li><strong>Common leaf spot - Pseudopeziza trifolii:</strong> Prune and remove heavily affected leaves. If there is only one spot or two, skip this and follow the next steps, provide frequent treatment of neem oil or another fungicide to the foliage. Copper-based fungicides are safe and effective for most plants, but always do your research – copper can be harmful to certain plants, avoid getting water onto the leaves as it recovers, keep the plant away from other plants temporarily. This will prevent the infection from spreading to the foliage of your other plants, monitor daily to ensure the infection has stopped spreading, repeat steps 1-5 until you’re certain the plant has beat the infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Pepper spot - Leptosphaerulina trifolii:</strong> Once identified, the fungus can be effectively eliminated by removing the horses from the infected pastures and using a pasture-friendly broad-leaf herbicide to eliminate any remaining broadleaf plants, such as clover. Another clover likely to grow in your pastures as fall weather begins is alsike clover.</li>
        <li><strong>Sooty blotch - Cymadothea trifolii:</strong> Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) is a new, moderately effective fungicide for control of sooty blotch/flyspeck. Potassium bicarbonate is more effective treatment for control of apple diseases, particularly powdery mildew in organic orchards.</li>

        <li><strong>DOLLAR SPOT - Sclerotinia homoeocarpa:</strong> Apply a slow-release organic fertilizer high in nitrogen; applying liquid seaweed and chelated iron is also helpful. Do NOT over fertilize, since this can result in an increase of other turf grass diseases such as brown patch. Over seed in the fall with resistant turf cultivars.</li>
        <li><strong>FAIRY RING - Marasmius oreades:</strong> Briskway, Velista and Posterity brand fungicides will provide season long control that protects your course from fairy ring.</li>
        <li><strong>GRAY LEAF SPOT - Pyricularia grisea:</strong> Avoid high nitrogen levels during mid-summer. Irrigate turf deeply and as infrequently as possible to avoid water stress. Allow water to remain on leaves for only a short period of time. Reduce thatch by verti-cutting. Prevent soil compaction. Avoid using herbicides or plant growth regulators when the disease is active.</li>
        <li><strong>POWDERY MILDEW - Podosphaera xanthii:</strong> To eradicate mild to heavy powdery mildew infections, use a horticultural oil such as JMS Stylet Oil, Saf-T-Side Spray Oil, Sunspray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil, or one of the plant-based oils such as neem oil (e.g., Powdery Mildew Killer) or jojoba oil (e.g., E-rase).</li>
        <li><strong>Summer Patch - Magnaporthe poae:</strong> Mowing at the correct height for your grass type. Watering deeply yet infrequently. Feeding regularly with Scotts® Turf Builder® Lawn Food, following label directions. Aerating and dethatching the lawn as needed. Overseeding regularly with Scotts® Turf Builder® Thick'R Lawn™ Sun & Shade or Scotts® Turf Builder® Thick'R Lawn™ Tall Fescue Mix (per label directions). Both contain turfgrass species that are resistant to summer patch, plus a fertilizer designed to make soil more acidic, which can reduce the severity of the disease.</li>
