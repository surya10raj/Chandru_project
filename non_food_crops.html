            <h3> tobacco </h3>
          <p>  The tobacco plant has been an important part of magical and religious rituals by Native American peoples for many centuries before the arrival of the Europeans.
            Products made from the leaves were applied externally as poultices for boils or skin infections and sores, as well as for bruises and sprains.
            Teas made from tobacco leaves were used against intestinal worms, as a laxative, to induce vomiting (emetic), as an expectorant, for fainting and dizziness, as well as for headaches.
            Tobacco leaves are applied to cuts as an antiseptic and to stop bleeding.
            Ground tobacco leaves were also used as “snuff” (inhaled through the nose) for medicinal and ritualistic purposes.
            Tobacco smoked is sometimes blown into the ear to treat earaches.
